# PDFYantra 📄✨

**The privacy-first PDF toolkit that runs entirely in your browser.**

PDFYantra is a free, simple tool to help you manage your PDF documents without worrying about privacy. Unlike other online tools, PDFYantra **does not upload your files to any server**. Everything happens right on your device, ensuring your sensitive documents stay safe.

## 🌟 Features

*   **Organize & Merge:** Drag and drop multiple PDF files. Rearrange pages, rotate them, delete the ones you don't need, and combine everything into a single new document.
*   **Split Documents:** Extract specific pages or split a large document into smaller parts (like chapters) automatically.
*   **Convert Formats:**
    *   Turn PDF pages into images (JPG, PNG) or plain text.
    *   Create PDFs from images, Word docs, Excel sheets, or text files.
*   **Compress:** Reduce the file size of your PDFs to make them easier to share via email.
*   **Visual Editor:** See exactly what you are doing with high-quality thumbnail previews of every page.
*   **Dark Mode:** A beautiful interface that looks great day or night.

## 🔒 Privacy First

We take your privacy seriously.
*   **No Uploads:** Your files never leave your computer.
*   **No Tracking:** We don't store your documents.
*   **Offline Capable:** Once the app is loaded, the processing happens locally on your machine.

## 📖 How to Use

1.  **Open the App:** Launch PDFYantra in your web browser.
2.  **Add Files:** Drag and drop your PDF files onto the "Home" screen or the "Organizer".
3.  **Edit:**
    *   Use the **Organizer** tab to move pages around, merge files, or fix rotations.
    *   Use **Split** to break files apart.
    *   Use **Convert** or **Compress** for specific tasks.
4.  **Download:** Click the export/download button to save your new file instantly.

## 🚀 Getting Started (For Developers)

If you want to run this project on your own computer:

1.  Download or clone this repository.
2.  Because this app uses modern browser features (ES Modules), you need to run it on a simple local web server. Opening `index.html` directly via the file system may not work in some browsers due to security policies.
    *   *Example using Python:* `python3 -m http.server`
    *   *Example using Node:* `npx http-server`
3.  Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000` (or whichever port your server uses).
